	   This option enables support for the eYs3D eCV5546 SoCs with a
	   Display Engine.
	   This driver is necessary for drm framework that wishes to utilize the
	   SoCs Hardware Display for its intended purposes. Without this driver,
	   the device will not be recognized or accessible by the system.
	   Please note that this driver requires the SOC_eCV5546 and VIDEO_DEV
	   to be enabled as well, as it depends on certain functionality
	   provided by that option.

	  DRM panel driver for dumb panels that need at most a regulator and
	  a GPIO to be powered up. Optionally a backlight can be attached so
	  that it can be automatically turned off when the panel goes into a
	  low power state.
